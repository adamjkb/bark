# Playground

You may use this directory to have a play around with Bark.

There is already an SQLite database, pre-seeded in place so all you have to do is generate the Prisma Client if you haven't already.

```bash
pnpx prisma generate
```

After that you may run `pnpm start` to start a watch task on the `index.js` file.
