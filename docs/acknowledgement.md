# Acknowledgement

`prisma-extension-bark` drawn a great deal of motivation from Gustavo Pic√≥n's [`django-treebeard`](https://github.com/django-treebeard/django-treebeard) package and implementation of Materialized Paths. The addition of `depth` and `numchild` fields had been entirely originated from `django-treebeard`.&#x20;
